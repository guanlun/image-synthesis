Image Synthesis
==============

This project is my ray-tracing implementation in JavaScript.

### Overview
Definitely not as fancy and fast as my (many) previous ray-tracing projects, this small JS application only provides basic ray-tracing features.

### How to run it
Run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" in this directory and open "http://localhost:8000/".
